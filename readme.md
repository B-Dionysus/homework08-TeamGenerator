## Team Generator
Ask the user a series of questions about their team.

This team must have one manager, and any number of engineers and interns.

After taking the user's input, this generates an html page at /Develop/output/
(e.g., https://b-dionysus.github.io/homework08-TeamGenerator/Develop/output)
